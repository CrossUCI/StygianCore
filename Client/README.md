## Download Client and/or Client Update

This StygianCore Client Update does not contain the full WoW 3.3.5a client, it only contains the updates to add HQ models, random animated login screens, and custom item patches for StygianCore. You will need to apply this patch to an **unmodified** World of Warcraft v3.3.5a client. You can download an original WoW 3.3.5a client from the link above.

**Attempting to use this update with a client that has existing mods or patches may cause crashes, errors, or missing models/textures during gameplay.**
