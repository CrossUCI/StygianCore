# Tools

This folder holds the tools and data required to restore or update the repack.

## Work

- This folder holds the restoration archive data and tools which includes all SQL, conf, and other game data files.
- If you intend to add or modify database content, or change the configuration of the server or modules, all edits should be made here so they are bundled and deployed during a restore event.

### Repack Update Workflow

- See the Work\Readme.md for more detailed information about updating the restoration archive and workflow examples for making changes to repack's game content.
