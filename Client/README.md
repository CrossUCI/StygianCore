# Data

This folder holds client patches for game data files. These patches are not required to run the repack, but doing so ensures _as intended_ play and avoids issues that may arise due to missing icons, textures, and other game assets.

**Copy the client patch files from the repack's _ClientPatch_ folder to your client's _Data_ folder. These files are required to support custom items, objects, and other content in the repack.**

> **_NOTE: Be sure to delete your client's cache folder after copying the new patches!_**

- ### PATCH-Z.MPQ (_REQUIRED_)

This is the client support patch required to display and enable custom content in the repack.

- Required to support custom items and content in the StygianCore repack.
- Required to enable access to forbidden zones.
- Required to enable custom textures on some custom NPCs.

**_If this patch is NOT installed:_**
  
- Custom items will appear as a **?** icon in your character's backpack.
- Custom NPCs will not display custom weapons and armor.
- Custom NPCs will not display the correct textures.
- The game client will crash when attempting to access forbidden zones.
